Course equipment will be available for your use during workshops and to make your assignments. There is enough equipment for this class to work in pairs. The equipment list includes:

*   Canon VIXIA HF R500 Camcorders
*   Smith-Victor Apollo 2800 Tripods
*   Sony ECM-44B Lavalier Microphones

There is also a DSLR and LED light kit available to students who would like to create higher production-value projects. You are also welcome to use your own cameras, tripods, mic, etc. For many assignments, using an iPhone camera may actually work just fine.
